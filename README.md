# qiskit-intros
This set of notebooks gives pointers on how to get started with running quantum algorithms using Qiskit.

[1_ready](1_ready.ipynb) Makes sure you have all the necessary prerequisites to get Qiskit running
[2_terra](2_terra.ipynb) Gives some first examples on Qiskit Terra -- Qiskit's foundation element
[3_aer](3_aer.ipynb) Gives you some ideas on how to simulate quantum circuits with realistic noise models
[4_resources](4_resources.ipynb) Points you to some useful places to find examples and demonstrations of quantum algorithms with Qiskit
